              Our Group is made up of two companies, JK Sons Engineers Pvt. Ltd. (JKSEPL) and Bilaspur Mining Industries
              Pvt. Ltd.
              (BMIPL), both of which are based in Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh. We began our journey in 2008 with a
              traditional
              stitched bag
              unit capable of producing 3600 MT per year. As rightly said “Every big castle was once started with a
              single
              block;
              despise no small beginnings. A little step taken every day builds up the hope of greater accomplishments.
              Do
              something
              every day!”

              expanded in 2012 and successfully installed our first fully integrated block bottom plant from Starlinger,

              i.e. JK Sons
              and Bilaspur Mining, using our own logistics fleets. Our plants are fully equipped with in-house quality
              testing and
              storage.
              <b>JKSEPL and BMIPL, with a combined installed capacity of 600 million bags per year, are India's largest
                manufacturers of
